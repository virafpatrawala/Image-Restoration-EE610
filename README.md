# Image-Restoration-EE610

Hello,

This is an assignment under the course EE610: Image Processing at IIT Bombay.

Inverse Filtering, Wiener Filtering and Constrained Least Squares Filtering has been carried out to deblur an image whose kernel is known.

2 Dimensional FFT has been implemented using 1 Dimensional FFT first on the rows, then the columns.
